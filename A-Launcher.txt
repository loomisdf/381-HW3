Exploring the Launcher
----------------------

Command line parsing questions

A1. MAX_LINE_LEN and MAX_ARGS are defined, but there is no comparable
definition for the maximum length of a single argument string.  Is that
ok?  Why or why not? (Hint: See the manpage for strtok.)
===Write your answer here:

A2. Try adding a blank line to the launch_set file and running the
launcher.  Something bad will happen.  Explain and fix this bug. 
(All of the commands in the file should be executed without error.)
===Write your explanation here:

You can test your bug fix using the command
./launch -test all

Fork and exec questions

A3. Explain what the return value of fork() means and how this program
uses it.
===Write your explanation here:

A4. What would happen if this program did not use the fork function, but
just called execv directly?  (You can test your hypothesis: Try changing
line 100 from 'pid = fork();' to 'pid = 0;')
===Write your answer here:

A5. What is the role of the status variable?
===Write your answer here:

A6. Run './launch launch_set' several times.  You should see some
variation in the output.  What is happening?  Why?
===Write your answer here:

Experimenting with other commands

A7. Try adding a nonexistant command (e.g., "fasdfjaskf" or
"argelfraster") to the launch set.  What happens?  Why?
===Write your answer here:

A8. Try adding the command 'cd ..' to the launch_set file.  What happens?
Why?  (Hint: Learn what the 'which' command does; then try typing 'which
cd' in bash.)
===Write your answer here:

A9. Given what you learned in A6, is the behavior you saw in A8
appropriate?  Is the cd command useful in the launch program?  Why or
why not?
