Our shell took roughly 8 hours to implement. We didn't run into too many problems other than matching our own output to the example. All of the problemswe had were with the C-language itself and some seg faults.

We managed to get all the parts working, including the changing directories. We didn't do any of the extra credit parts. For solving the problems we consulted the linux man pages, and if we were really stuck we looked at some stack overflow questions. Usually the man pages were enough.
